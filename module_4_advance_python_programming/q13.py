# Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?
"""
Exception handling is a way to deal with problems that might happen when a computer program is running. It helps the program stay on track and not crash when unexpected things occur.

There are two main types of error in python:

    Syntax error -  It occurs when code doesnt follow the correct syntax rules.

    Exception - It occurs at runtime like divide by zero.
